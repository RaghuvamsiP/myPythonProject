# we need to know 3 points: 1. starting point 2. ending point 3. How we need to put the condition

# Difference b/w conditional statement and looping statement
# in the conditional statement, just condition will be verified and statement will be executed only once
# in the looping statement, just condition will be verified multiple times and statement will be executed multiple times till the condition become false
